Fluxconf is a graphical (Gtk) application which helps you changing the fluxbox
configuration. It includes fluxconf, fluxkeys and fluxmenu, one app for the
base configuration, one other for keybinds configuration, and the last for menu
edition.


HOWTO:

fluxconf:
	Run fluxconf, then make your changes. When you want to apply your changes
	press the "Save" button, go to the fluxbox menu (configuration section) and
	press "Restart". This is needed to make fluxbox reading your changes.

	Once everything I've just wrote is done, you can press
	"Let fluxbox change the conf" button then quit the app ("Quit" button ;)

fluxkeys:	
	Nothing complicated, to add a keybind line press the "Add" button, fill the
	entry as desired. To remove an entry just let the first textbox of the line
	blank. Once you're done, press "Save" button.

fluxmenu: Gtk2 ONLY !!
	It's heavily based on drag&drop, you can edit each entry, add or del what you
	want. "Save" will just save, the changes are made instantly.


THANKS:

	To all guys which send me comments/patches, and to the #fluxbox chan on OPN.


PROBLEMS:

	If someone get problems compiling this, try with "./configure --without-pkgconfig".
